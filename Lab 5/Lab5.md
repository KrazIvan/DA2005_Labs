### Lab 5 Explanation ###

This lab takes a look at a computational problem from modern molecular biology. In DNA sequence analysis, we sometimes want to know how much overlap there is between two sequences (simplified: how much DNA they have in common). This lab support such an analysis with object-oriented code.

The lab contains some test functions. The test functions have two purposes. (1) They make testing easier and faster. It is often convenient to have some basic testing available. Later, we will look at “real” systematic testing. (2) The test is a codified specification of how the functions should work. Everything works as intended when the call test_all() prints "Yay, all good".

The code's functionality is explained by docstrings.
